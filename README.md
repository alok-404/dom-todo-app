# Todo App (Vanilla JavaScript)

A simple Todo application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice core **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **localStorage**, and **filtering logic**.

## 🚀 Features
- Add, delete, and edit todos
- Mark todos as completed / pending
- Persistent data using localStorage
- Search todos in real time
- Filter todos (All / Completed / Pending)
- Basic input validation

## 🧠 What I Learned
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners and event flow
- Using arrays as a source of truth
- Filtering and rendering dynamic lists
- localStorage CRUD operations
- Refactoring repetitive UI logic

## ⚠️ Note
This project is built as a **learning milestone**, not a production-ready app.  
The code will be refactored and improved as my understanding grows.

## 📌 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📅 Progress
Day 1–3: Core functionality + validation + filters  
Further improvements planned (refactor, edge cases, better UX)
