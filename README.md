# Todo App (Vanilla JavaScript)

A Todo application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** as a learning-focused project to strengthen my understanding of **DOM manipulation, application flow, and state management**.

This project is intentionally kept simple in UI but strong in logic.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new todos with validation
- Edit existing todos
- Delete todos
- Mark todos as completed / pending
- Search todos in real time
- Filter todos (All / Completed / Pending)
- Persistent data using localStorage

---

## 🧠 What I’m Actually Learning (Honest)
- How data (`allTodos`) drives the entire UI
- How multiple event listeners work together in a larger file
- Why rendering logic must be centralized
- How confusion increases as app size grows — and how to deal with it
- Debugging and understanding **flow**, not just writing code

---

## ⚠️ Current Challenge (Important)
- I can build **small features confidently**
- As the app grows, understanding the **full flow at once** becomes harder
- I’m actively working on:
  - Reading my own code line-by-line
  - Refactoring instead of rewriting blindly
  - Reducing confusion in larger files

This project reflects **real learning**, not copy-paste perfection.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- localStorage

---

## 📅 Progress Log
- **Day 1–2:** Core Todo logic + DOM basics  
- **Day 3:** Validation, filters, search, edit functionality  
- **Day 4:** Code understanding, flow clarity, and refactoring mindset  

Further improvements will focus on cleaner structure and better flow control.

## 📌 Note
This is a learning milestone project.  
Code quality and structure will improve as I progress.
